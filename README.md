# PredMachLearn-031
Practical Machine Learning Course Project

## Introduction

This repo presents all the code that I developed for the Practical Machine Learning Course Project. This is the eighth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization at [Coursera](www.coursera.org).

This course provides the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications.

Please refer to RMD and HTML files for all about the code for this assignment. 

One option to see the HTML file is to see the [pdf](https://github.com/MSena/PredMachLearn-031/blob/master/PreMachLear.pdf) version.

This assignment makes use of the WLE dataset, from the following source:

Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H. Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises. Proceedings of 4th International Conference in Cooperation with SIGCHI (Augmented Human '13) . Stuttgart, Germany: ACM SIGCHI, 2013.
