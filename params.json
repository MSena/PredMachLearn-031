This is the eighth course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization at [Coursera](www.coursera.org).\r\n\r\nThis course provides the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications.\r\n\r\nThis assignment makes use of the WLE dataset, from the following source:\r\n\r\nVelloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H.
